# Python scripts

Assortment of scripts that run on the command line, i.e. *Terminal* on Mac OS X, and *Command Prompt* on Windows.

## Description

### `buildAll.py`
For a given directory, this script goes through every subfolder and runs `makeOTF` for each font source file (`.ufo`, `.pfa`) found. 

`makeOTF` is run with the following options:  
`-r`: release mode  
    * subroutinization turned on  
    * strict error-reporting  
    * GlyphOrderAndAliasDB is applied   

`-gs`: glyphs not listed in the GlyphOrderAndAliasDB are removed from the resulting font file

---

### `checkAll.py`

Run `checkOutlines -e` to remove overlaps in all source files (`.ufo`, `.pfa`) contained in a given directory tree.  

`-e`: This option results in changes to outlines. For a PFA file means that overlapping glyphs will be replaced by new ones (therefore may be lost). In a UFO file, new glyphs are written to a new `glyphs.com.adobe.type.processedGlyphs` layer, which does not interfere with the foreground, and is used by `makeotf` to generate font binaries.

---

### `hintAll.py`

Run `autohint -q` to add hints to all glyphs in in all source files (`.ufo`, `.pfa`) contained in a given directory tree. 

`-q`: quiet operation

In a UFO file, hinted glyphs are written to a new `glyphs.com.adobe.type.processedGlyphs` layer, which does not interfere with the foreground, and is used by `makeotf` to generate font binaries.

---

### `generateAllKernFiles.py`

For each source file in a given directory tree, generate a `kern.fea` file, which can be referenced in a `features` file (as expected by `makeOTF`).  
The `kern.fea` file contains only raw kern data made of groups and lookups, and must be wrapped in feature tags by way of a `include` statement.  
It may look like this:
    
    feature kern {
        include (kern.fea);
    } kern;

It is possible to change settings for generating kern files (such as minimum kerning value, writing of subtables, etc.) directly in the script file.

---

### `generateOneKernFile.py`

Generate a single `kern.fea` file for a given UFO. The resulting file can be used in the same way as explained above. This script’s options can also be changed as explained above.

---

### `generateAllMarkFiles.py`

For each font source file in a given directory tree, generates `mark.fea`, `markclasses.fea`, and `mkmk.fea` files, which can be used in a `features` file (as expected by `makeOTF`).  
The `m*.fea` files contain only raw mark data, and must be wrapped in feature tags by way of an `include` statement. It may look like this:

    include (markclasses.fea);

    feature mark {
        include (mark.fea);
    } mark;

    feature mkmk {
        include (mkmk.fea);
    } mkmk;
    

This script can also create `abvm.fea` and `blwm.fea` files for Indic scripts. More information in the script file itself.

---

### `generateOneMarkFiles.py`

Generate mark files (as explained above) for a single UFO.

---

### `ufo2pfa.py`
Convert all UFO files in a given directory tree to PFA (PostScript Type 1) files, using `tx`.

---

### `ufo2txt.py`
Convert all UFO files in a given directory tree to TXT files, using `tx`.  
TXT files are decrypted PostScript Type 1 (PFA) files.

---

### `pfa2txt.py`
Converts all PFA files in a given directory tree to TXT files, using `tx`.  
TXT files are decrypted PostScript Type 1 (PFA) files.

---

### `UFOInstanceGenerator.py`
(Deprecated workflow, but a great starter for interpolation).  
Generate UFO instances from two or more masters, in a one- or two axis MultipleMaster setup. Requires a settings file called `instances`, the contents of which are better described within the script itself.

## Installation

**Mac OS X**: A version of Python is already installed.  
**Windows**: You will need to install one of the 2.x versions available at [python.org](http://www.python.org/getit/).

## Dependencies

Some of the scripts may require additional Python packages or depend on certain tools being installed and appropriately configured to run on the command line.
Here is a list of the locations from which you may need to get the extra tools and packages:

* [Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType (AFDKO)](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko)
    * makeotf
    * autohint
    * tx
    * ttx
    * detype1
    * spot

* [FontTools](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools)

* [RoboFab](https://github.com/robofab-developers/robofab)

* [Type Supply Tools](https://github.com/typesupply)
    * defcon
    * ufo2fdk
    * woffTools

## General usage information

1. Download the [ZIP package](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/python-scripts/archive/master.zip) and unzip it.
2. 
 * Most of the scripts will run by simply typing `python ` followed by the file name of the script, e.g. `python theScript.py`.
 * If the script is in a different directory from which you are trying to run it, you will need to provide the full path to the script’s file, e.g. `python /Users/myself/foldername/theScript.py`.
 * Some scripts may allow you to use options, or require that you provide input files. To learn how to use those scripts, open them in a text editor app (e.g. TextEdit, Notepad) and read the documentation near the top of the file.
