checkAll v1.0 - July 9 2013

This script takes a path to a folder as input, finds all the Type 1 fonts
(.pfa files) inside that folder and its subdirectories, and corrects them 
using the FDK's checkOutlines tool. If a path is not provided, the script will 
use the current path as the top-most directory.
The script ignores MM PFA fonts, usually named 'mmfont.pfa'.
The Type 1 fonts can also be in plain text format (.txt) where the Private 
and CharStrings dictionaries are not encrypted. These files can be obtained
by using the FDK's detype1 tool.

v1.0 - Feb 22 2013 - Initial release
